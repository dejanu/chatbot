Tenants cannot login into cluster you can try to check if vault is working (kubectl -n vault get po) and check the vault status.
Vault is sealed you can try to check the logs (kubectl logs -n vault vault-0) check vault status using (vaultstatus) and unseal the vault (./invoke-bundle-action.sh synergy-core unseal-vault).

Node CPU alert you can try to check nodes resource utilization (kubectl top nodes) and check node pod alocation (knode_pods).

Synergy bundles deployable artifacts are a set of Cloud Native Application Bundles also referred to as just bundles.A Synergy release consists of a set of bundles that are installed individually, but in an order that honours the individual dependencies between them. Which bundles are installed, depends on the capabilities that a specific cluster should support, check which bundles are installed using (porter list).
Check installed bundles (porter list), available bundles (some are mandatory and some are optional):
- The Istio bundle is the first of the mandatory bundles (mandatory) it provides the configuration for properly exposing services in the cluster and the communication and policies for collaborating services.
- The Bootstrap bundle (mandatory) it provides Harbor.
- The Core bundle (mandatory) it provides Keycloak as Identity Provider, Vault, Kubernetes Dashboard (UI for inspecting the cluster) and Synergy Operator and Synergy console
- The GitOps bundle (optional)
- The Monitoring bundle (optional) it provides Prometheus (Metrics gathering), Grafana (Metrics Visualization) and Kiali (Mesh visualization)
- The Logging bundle (optional) it provides Opensearch (Logs aggregation), Opensearch Dashboard (Logs visualization) and Fluentd (Logs processing)
- The Tracing bundle (optional) it provides Jaeger (Distributed tracing)
- The ACME bundle (optional).
- The Knative bundle (optional).

Harbor registry issues when persistent volume is full (kubectl -n harbor get po,pvc).In general the actions that needs to be taken is to increase the requested amount of storage in the persistent-volume-claim and then stop the application while the volume is being resized and then start it again.

OpenSearch Dashboards returns Unauthorized, the OpenSearch Dashboards will receive "503 Service Unavailable" from Keycloak, which causes the security plugin to not be configured properly, and currently OpenSearch Dashboards do not report this during its health check and therefore do not recover automatically. Restart OpenSearch Dashboards (kubectl -n logging rollout restart deployment opensearch-dashboards).
OpenSearch fails to store log as data node disk is full (OpenSearch is unable to perform searches).OpenSearch data nodes are configured using a statefulset meaning that resizing the data disk requires an approach like for each data pod in the opensearch-cluster-data  statefulset do the following (replace <ordinal> with the id of the replica being resized)
delete the statefulset (kubectl -n logging delete statefulset opensearch-cluster-data --cascade=orphan) and modify the PVC to request the new size (kubectl -n logging edit pvc opensearch-cluster-data-opensearch-cluster-data-<ordinal>). Recreate the statefulset using: ./invoke-bundle-action.sh synergy-logging update

Fluentbit is a daemonset (one on each node) that tails container logs and decorates with Kubernetes metadata.These forward to Fluentd which will buffer and send to Elasticsearch including some filtering/manipulation.
Delete all Fluentbit pods (kubectl -n logging delete po -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=fluent-bit)killing Fluentbit and Fluentd will clear their caches which may be holding up the entire log pipeline.

Certificates are expired you can try to check private registry certs (openssl s_client -connect private_registry_fqdn:5443 -showcerts|openssl x509 -noout -dates) and cluster certs (openssl x509 -in fullchain.cer -noout -dates) with respect to certificates location, also you can generate new ones (issue-cluster-certificate-acme-azuredns.sh|issue-cluster-certificate-acme-powerdns.sh|issue-registry-certificate-acme-azuredns.sh|issue-registry-certificate-acme-powerdns.sh) and sync the certificate and the key into the cluster (./invoke-bundle-action.sh synergy-istio sync-ssl-certificate).
The certificate for the cluster ingress is issued by Let's Encrypt the validity period is only 3 months, please check certificates are expired.The certificate for the private registry is expired, renew the certificate and restart docker containers (docker ps -q -f name=synergy-registry | xargs -n 1 docker restart), please check certificates are expired.

Check which Istio version is being used by the applications (./invoke-bundle-action.sh synergy-istio istio-version).
